# pathfinder-prd

This project provides a Java API for the Pathfinder速 Roleplaying Game System Reference Document (PRD). 
PRD objects can be represented and managed using this API, which tries to be a foundation for other tools
for the Pathfinder速 Roleplaying Game.

This project does not contain any content beyond core rule elements. It does, however, provide a loader to 
download the content from the official Paizo速 Pathfinder速 [PRD website](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/).
